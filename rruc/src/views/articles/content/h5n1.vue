                The Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) released a statement on December 13, 2024, indicating the first presumptive positive human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), or H5N1, in southwestern Louisiana. The patient is reportedly hospitalized and had exposure to sick or dead birds.

              <p class="text-h5 font-weight-regular mb-16 text-grey-darken-2">
                This development marks a significant milestone for public health in Louisiana. According to LDH and the CDC, H5N1 bird flu has been circulating among wild birds and poultry in various parts of the country. While human infections are rare, the agency's statement underscores the need for vigilance and preventive measures, particularly for those who work with or handle birds.
